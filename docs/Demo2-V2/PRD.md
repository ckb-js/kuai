# User Stories of the Second demo:Support WalletConnect

## Background

With the development of the WalletConnect Protocol, users can be able to connect a dapp directly to a wallet.

Kuai project has implemented connection with metamask , could be improved to support the new feature, that is WalletConnect. To do so, we improve the second demo of kuai project. It will show the dapp which kuai will help developers to build and help users to connect to their wallets.

## Abstract

This documentation describes the product requirements of the second demo of kuai project.

The second demo of Kuai is a sudt dapp which allows a Token Minter to mint/manage token and Holders to transfer token.

> Notes: The requirements mentioned here are for some specific requirements general and easy to understand. Developers can adjust/modify/rewrite the whole implementation once they understand the framework of kuai.

## Documentation

### Rules
- The SUDT tool allows users create SUDT using both MetaMask or other wallets which supports CKB WalletConnect RFC.
- One address is supposed to be used to generate the SUDT only once.
- While connecting to an Account by WalletConnect, when the users want to generate SUDT , this app will automaticly pick up the addresses which are never used before to generate the SUDT. If none, users will not be able to generate but only manage them.
- This account is also the MINTER of the token, and the only account that can mint more tokens. 
### Flows

#### Login
Users need to connect to the site by Metamask or WalletConnect in order to log in and use this SUDT management tool.

> After connecting the testnet at firt time , for a new account, the CKB balance will mostly be 0. Then a window will pop up to help claim Test CKB.

First login with an brand new account on testnet, users may see this:

There will be a faucet icon for user to claim test CKB just like the current website do.
Also if the userâ€™s CKB balance is lower than 100CKB , a window will pop up to help him/her to get test CKB.

![pic 11](pic/HistoryTab.png)  


- TXID

  The theme color highlights the TXID (transaction hash), which can be clicked to navigate to the transaction details page on the blockchain explorer.
- From/To/Mint

  For the user's address in this transaction, the SUDT balance will be displayed as increased under "From" and decreased under "To". Specially, If the transaction is a mint transaction which means the out put SUDT amount is bigger than the input SUDT.
- From/To Address*

  The To address is marked with an underline, and clicking on it will navigate to the address details page on the blockchain explorer.

  [Note] In a typical CKB UTXO transaction, there may be more than one From address and To address. However, in this demo, the input/output address count is limited (with the change address being the same as the To address), so there is only one From address and a single output address other than the From address.

  [Enhanced Compatibility] If the transaction has two or more From addresses or three or more To addresses, the number of these addresses will be marked behind the From/To addresses.

- SUDT Amount Change

  The SUDT balance for the user addresses changes after this transaction.

> If possible, the mint transaction and the modification transaction should be also tag or in the hover bubble.

Thus user can create his own SUDT here. And distribute the SUDT to a list of addresses.
