# Development

## Quick Start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ckb-js/kuai.git
cd kuai
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

## Conventions

- all unit tests are under `packages/*/__tests__`
- each commit should be [signed](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits)
- dependencies should be fixed for clarity and certainty
